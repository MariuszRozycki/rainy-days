E-commerce project (The project is developed constantly and will be until the end of study). 
This is a cross-study project I started in 2021.

## Description

### First step
First assumption of project was to deliver properly functioning and responsive webside design. Design and prototypes were made in Adobe XD.<br>
Link to prototypes: https://xd.adobe.com/view/1e4b7d4a-f267-427b-8462-aa30890e59d8-4b18/ as a part of design study module.

### Second step
Next step was to create basic code in HTML and CSS based on prototypes created in Adobe XD. <br>
Assumptions of this assignment were:
- neat and semantic HTML,
- CSS follows the DRY principle,
- the website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars,
- use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate,
- no use of CSS framework like Bootstrap, just pure CSS,
- the site is WCAG compliant and accessibility,
- each page have a unique meta description, title, and h1,
- all code written by me.

### Third step
In this step I used WordPress REST API to manage the products. As a first assumptions products were placed in object in Java Script file, but during this step I used Java Script to fetch products from WP REST API. To make it I installed WordPress on my web host and made the call to the WP REST API. Another important assumption was to make a website HEADLESS.<br>

Third step assumptions:
- create an installation of WordPress on my web host,
- ensure to set it to be headless so that the front-end generated by WordPress was hidden from the public,
- add the WooCommerce plugin and add products onto the site,
- using JavaScript, fetch the data from the WordPress REST API and add it to your website in the relevant sections of your cross-course project,
- using query string parameters allow the user to click on an individual item in the product list and take them to see data of that product. 

## Built with
To built this project I used:
- HTML, CSS, JS,
- WordPress REST API,
- one.com web host,
- worked with Visual Studio Code.
