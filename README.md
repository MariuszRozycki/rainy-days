E-commerce project (The project is developed constantly and will be until end of study). 
This is a cross-study project I started in 2021.

## Description
First assumption of project was to deliver properly functioning and responsive webside design. Design and prototypes were made in Adobe XD.<br>
Link to prototypes: https://xd.adobe.com/view/1e4b7d4a-f267-427b-8462-aa30890e59d8-4b18/ as a part of design study module.

Next step was to create basic code in HTML and CSS based od prototypes created in Adobe XD. <br>
Assumptions of this assignment were:
- neat and semantic HTML,
- CSS follows the DRY principle,
- the website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars,
- use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate,
- no use of CSS framework like Bootstrap, just pure CSS,
- the site is WCAG compliant and accessibility,
- each page have a unique meta description, title, and h1
- all code written by me
