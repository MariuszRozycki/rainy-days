E-commerce (The project will be developed at the end of 2022). 
This is a cross-study project I started in 2021. First assumption was to deliver properly functioning, responsive webside for design project 
made in Adobe XD https://xd.adobe.com/view/1e4b7d4a-f267-427b-8462-aa30890e59d8-4b18/ as a part of design study module.
Another assumptions were:
- neat and semantic HTML
- CSS should follow the DRY principle
- The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. NO use of CSS framework like Bootstrap, to show I can build responsive sites without the help of a CSS framework
- The site should be WCAG compliant and accessibility taken into account
- Each page should have a unique meta description, title, and h1
- All code must be written by me
